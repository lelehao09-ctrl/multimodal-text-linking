# LIGHT: Multi-Modal Text Linking for Historical Maps
This repository provides training and inference scripts for **LIGHT**, an approach for linking text instances on historical maps.

**LIGHT** is a multi-modal learning model that jointly models text content, spatial layouts, polygonal shapes, and visual features to resolve complex linking challenges in scanned historical maps.

📢 The paper has been accepted for **oral presentation at ICDAR 2025**.

## 📚 Pretraining

### 1. Polygon Encoder Pretraining

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0" torchrun \
  --nproc_per_node=1 \
  --nnodes=1 \
  --node_rank=0 \
  --master_addr=127.0.0.1 \
  --master_port=14476 \
  pretrain_poly.py --config configs/pretrain_poly.yaml
```

### 2. Full LIGHT Model Pretraining

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0" torchrun \
  --nproc_per_node=1 \
  --nnodes=1 \
  --node_rank=0 \
  --master_addr=127.0.0.1 \
  --master_port=14476 \
  pretrain.py --config configs/pretrain_light.yaml
```

## 🔧 Fine-Tuning

```bash
python train.py --config configs/light.yaml
```

## 🔍 Inference

```bash
python inference.py \
  --test_dataset MapText_test \
  --out_file predict.json \
  --prob_out_file top3_probabilities.json \
  --model_dir ./_weights/finetune_light \
  --anno_path [WORD-LEVEL SPOTTING JSON] \
  --img_dir [IMAGE DIR]
```

`--prob_out_file` optionally writes the top successor candidates for every word
before greedy edge selection. It defaults to three candidates; use `--top_k` to
change that number. Each entry includes the source text and polygon vertices;
each candidate includes the target text and polygon vertices, forward
probability, and reverse-direction probability. The probability file is written
inside `--model_dir` unless an absolute path is supplied.

## 📁 Notes

- Create a Conda environment from [env.yaml](env.yaml)
- All dataset configurations are in the `dataset/buildin.py`. You need to update the paths to your dataset and annotations. Contact [Yijun Lin](https://linyijun.github.io/) if you want to use the pretraining datasets. We use [ICDAR24 MapText competition Rumsey dataset](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=28) for finetuning and testing.
- All config files are in the `configs` directory. You can modify hyperparameters or dataset settings.
- You can download model weights from Google Drive: [Polygon Pretrain Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qo0u1cVdrQ3vQOBH_PUGNF7BOjDbG3OP?usp=drive_link), [LIGHT Pretrain Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YhqYR7qjL0lp-gCnv0BYxin2FfvRdupD?usp=drive_link), [LIGHT Fintuned Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Ups2gbW7EVAttD17KPTF3V5O-_Zd96m?usp=drive_link)
- We provide a [word-level spotting data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1srQ5oOwa8Uzn6OkZkqzCdAC7SEaLt5r3?usp=drive_link) from [PALETTE](https://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc) (as an input to the model).
